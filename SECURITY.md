## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid potential exploitation.

### 2. **Email us directly**
Send detailed information to: [security@aicallbot.com](mailto:security@aicallbot.com)

### 3. **Include the following information**
- **Type of issue**: Buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS, etc.
- **Full paths of source file(s)**: Related to the vulnerability
- **The number of line(s)**: Where the vulnerability exists
- **Any special configuration**: Required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions**: To reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code**: If available
- **Impact of the issue**: Including potential damage

### 4. **What to expect**
- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status updates**: Regular updates on progress
- **Public disclosure**: Coordinated release with fix

- **Security event logging** for incident response

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Keep software updated**: Regularly update to the latest version
2. **Use strong passwords**: Implement complex password policies
3. **Enable HTTPS**: Always use secure connections
4. **Monitor logs**: Regularly check for suspicious activity
5. **Backup data**: Maintain regular backups of conversations and settings

### For Developers
1. **Follow secure coding practices**: Input validation, output encoding
2. **Use dependency scanning**: Regularly update dependencies
3. **Implement least privilege**: Minimal required permissions
4. **Conduct security reviews**: Regular code security audits
5. **Test security features**: Automated security testing
